# Alex's Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In this project I show more techinical and algorithmic knowledge with a sorting visualizers proving that I understand the various sorting algorithms and what is actually happening visually. For each sorting algorithm I will give the pseudo code, complexity analysis, advantages, and disadvantages.

## Bubble Sort
- pseudo code
- complexity analysis
- advantages
- disadvantages

## Selection Sort
- pseudo code
- complexity analysis
- advantages
- disadvantages

## Insertion Sort
- pseudo code
- complexity analysis
- advantages
- disadvantages

## Merge Sort
- pseudo code
- complexity analysis
- advantages
- disadvantages
